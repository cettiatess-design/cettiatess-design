# I'm Tess,  an aspiring programmer and graphic designer.

* ### I like writing, coding, and drawing, so why not do all three?

  * I'm currently teaching myself the basics of programming and game design.
<sub> I'm sorta new to it, hehe </sub>
  * Additionally, I like to write my thoughts down. Maybe I'll start a blog.

**Stay tuned for more!** :bird:
